An attempt to give functionality to this project at the moment abamdonado, correct some bad behaviors and an attempt to improve it.

First give their deserved recognition to the principal authors of the project Gull and Syzygy end tables:

Vadim Demichev on public domain:
... Moreover, I believe that when someone releases an engine as a public domain project it's a kind of invitation 
"feel free to improve it and make it commercial"! Since nothing prevented the original authors to place a 
restriction on commercial use of their code.
