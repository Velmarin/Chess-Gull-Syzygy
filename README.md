# Chess-Gull-Syzygy
Chess uci engine with support Syzygy tablebassses

An attempt to give functionality to this project at the moment abandoned, correct some bad behaviors and an attempt to improve it.

The changes are still public domain.
First give their deserved recognition to the principal authors of the project Gull and Syzygy end tables:

Gull Author Vadim Demichev "ThinkingALot", gull is PUBLIC DOMAIN

Vadim Demichev on public domain:
... Moreover, I believe that when someone releases an engine as a public domain project it's a kind of invitation 
"feel free to improve it and make it commercial"! Since nothing prevented the original authors to place a 
restriction on commercial use of their code.

Author code SYZYGY:

This repository is the original Gull 3.0 code and code probe Syzygy embedded in the file.
True to the philosophy of ThinkingALot, all in a file.
There are several modifications to compile without errors in Visual Studio in a Windows environment.
